// Time complexity: O(n * Î±(n)), where Î± is the inverse Ackermann function
// Space complexity: O(n)

// Explanation:
// The code uses a disjoint set data structure to keep track of the connected components in the graph.
// The 'find' function performs path compression, which helps to optimize the find operation.
// The 'parent' array is used to represent disjoint sets, where each element initially points to itself.
// The code iterates through the edges and checks whether the two vertices of each edge belong to the same set.
// If they do, the edge is redundant, and the code returns it. Otherwise, the code performs a union operation to merge the sets.
// The time complexity is primarily determined by the 'find' function and the union operation, and it's nearly linear due to the inverse Ackermann function.
// The space complexity is O(n) due to the 'parent' array.

// Alternative: Using Union-Find with Rank and Path Compression
// Another way to implement the disjoint set is by maintaining rank to optimize union by rank.
// This doesn't significantly affect the time complexity in practice, but it provides a more balanced tree structure.
